Detailed Product Description:
ChatLure is a next-generation interactive storytelling app that lets users secretly watch fictional but hyper-realistic WhatsApp-style conversations unfold in real-time.

How ChatLure Works (User Journey):

Users land on a visually intriguing homepage displaying enticing teasers: each chat-story preview is crafted to instantly spark intrigue.

Selecting a teaser immerses users into a realistically simulated WhatsApp-style chat. Messages appear with real-time typing indicators, delays, and authentic texting quirks (emojis, typos, voice notes, images).

Each story unfolds gradually, heightening anticipation. Users feel compelled to keep watching, obsessively hooked by curiosity and emotional investment.

Key moments trigger prompts like: "Can't wait to find out? Share on social media to unlock instantly!"—boosting virality and leveraging social sharing loops.
